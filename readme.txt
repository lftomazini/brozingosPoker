Project: We create a version of Texas Hold’em Poker with the focus in the GUI elements of the game. There are a lot of card animations and visual elements that make the game more attractive and encourage  the user to keep playing. The rules of the game are the same as the regular Texas Hold’em version. Each player has two cards. There will be five cards on the table. These will be revealed at three different time: in the flop, turn and river, revealing three, one and one card(s), respectively. The players must form a hand at the end which will consist of five cards and must be either one of these, listed from the highest to the lowest:
- Royal flush: Five cards in numerical order, all of identical suits, being the ace the highest card.
- Straight Flush: Five cards in numerical order, all of identical suits.
- Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank, and one side card or ‘kicker’.
- Full House: Three cards of the same rank, and two cards of a different, matching rank.
- Flush: Five cards of the same suit.
- Straight: Five cards in sequence.
- Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank, and two unrelated side cards.
- Two pair: Two cards of a matching rank, another two cards of a different matching rank, and one side card.
- One pair: Two cards of a matching rank, and three unrelated side cards.
- High card: Any hand that does not qualify under a category listed above.

The players can fold (leave the game), increase bet (increase the amount of money they are betting), check (continue on the game without betting) and call (pay the same amount of money that the last player paid). Their decision should be based on the probability that they have one of the hands above listed, amount bet and the amount of money that they still have.

The player with the highest hand wins the game and gets all the money bet.

To run the game open the project in netBeans and run the Main.java file located in the route source.
